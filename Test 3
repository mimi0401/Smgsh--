Compared to the original vague prompt, I improved it by using a clear essay title, such as focusing only on how AI affects humans. I also asked the AI to write from the point of view of a high school student, which helped make the style more natural. 
In addition, I set a word limit to guide the length and asked for at least two examples. These changes gave the AI a better idea of what I wanted, and the answer about global warming became more detailed, organized, and easier to understand.
